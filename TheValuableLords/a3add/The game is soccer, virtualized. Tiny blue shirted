The game is soccer, virtualized. Tiny blue shirted and yellow shirted characters run, kick, and steal the ball from eachother in an ocean of green grass. Every time a goal is scored, the field doubles in size. Expanding the zone of play rapidly at first, eventually, it will take hours to reach a goal. However, the outer world itself sprawls infinitely in all directions, thus meaning the zone will never reach a defined edge, corner or loop back into itself. The two players map a boundless world. 
The game is entirely controlled through two Xbox controllers.
