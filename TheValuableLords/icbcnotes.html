:Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend.""
All honest, patriotic and revolutionary writers and artists must not treat their works and performances as a means of grabbing fame and fortune. The tendency towards bourgeois liberalism in ideological and cultural work and disregard for social consequences are incompatible with the policy of serving the poeple and socialism, and we must continue to criticize such trends. All ideological, cultural and art workers must cultivate a deep sense of responsibility to the people and live up to their expectations.

On December 31, 2015, the China Television Drama Production Industry Association posted new guidelines, including a ban on showing queer relationships on TV. The regulations stated: "No television drama shall show abnormal sexual relationships and behaviors, such as incest, same-sex relationships, sexual perversion, sexual assault, sexual abuse, sexual violence, and so on."

What is bourgeois liberalism?

Is sexuality

International Relations traditionally takes the nation-state as its unit of analysis. These are
the players in the arena of world politics. Or at least this was the case. Increasingly, there
is the realisation that this identification of nation-states in International Relations is no
longer sustainable. New players are making themselves heard, whether they are terrorist
cells working transnationally for radical goals, NGO’s lobbying to change national policies,
or multinational conglomerates with greater spending power than most countries.

Learning organization - > Peter M. Senge, The Fifth Discipline
Those who know how to learn
Things are interconnected
Change in one area will change things in another area
Personal mastery - honest reflection, our own personal dev
Awareness of our own biases- understand our mental models
Common understanding of shared future- where are we going?
Team learning - the practice of collaboration within everyone in the organization
systems thinking- appreciate institutions are all interconnected in 

Assumptions (Why we do what we do) -> Strategies and Techniques -> Results

Go back to strategies and techniques- the most common style of learning

Go back to assumptions - more than just fixing the problem, this style of learning questions the underlying assimptions, values, and beliefs of what we do. 


There are four challenges in initiating changes:

There must be a compelling case for change
There must be a time to change
There must be help during the change process
As the perceived barriers to change are removed, it is important that some new problem, not before considered important or perhaps not even recognized, doesn;t become a critical barrier

Feedback loops are not really loops - we have to consider the many balancing and reinforcing influences that affect the system

- prompt collaborative approaches to learning
- it's the individuals who learn
- the learning organization
. In The Fifth Discipline, Senge proposes five disciplines as characteristics of the learning organization,
including systems thinking, personal mastery, mental models, shared vision and team learning. Ironically,
aside from team learning, it is difficult to identify any other of these elements fully in the CCP’s present
operations.
Business ele

Information alone isn't enough to solve problems, thinking is how we build meaning from information

- being aware of how we think and how the world works
- think about our thinking
Mental model

Hume vs Hegel
Experience vs reason

In the twentieth century, Hume's constant skepticism lead to its own extreme result - analytic philosophy
Speculative philosopht is now dead. Philosophy;s role has become merely to analyze the workings of language.
