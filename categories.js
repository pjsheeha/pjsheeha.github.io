{title: "Soccer on an Expanding Field", date: "November 2019", tags:["games","performances", "installations", "sculptures"],description: "A 12 hour performance took place at the Ellis Gallery on November 6th from 6 am - 6 pm. A duo, Peter Sheehan and Mairead Dambruch, play a game on the floor, beer guzzler hats on to keep them motivated, diapered so that they do not have to draw away from the game for a single second, even for a bathroom break. The game is soccer, virtualized. Tiny blue shirted and yellow shirted characters run, kick, and steal the ball in an ocean of green grass.\nEvery time a goal is scored, the field doubles in size.\nExpanding the zone of play rapidly at first, eventually, it will take hours to reach a goal. However, the outer world itself sprawls infinitely in all directions, thus meaning the zone will never reach a defined edge, corner or loop back into itself. The two performers map a boundless world through the act of play, an example of Carse’s concept of the “infinite game,” whose only goal is to not let itself end. Any viewer can respectively take the position of the player at any moment by tapping them on their caps, and after the performance, any viewer can return to the Ellis and play Soccer on an Expanding field for themselves, for as long as they would like, until closing.", imgs : ["images/soccer1.png", "images/soccer2.png", "images/soccer3.png", "images/soccer4.png" ], links : ["https://perebite.itch.io/soccer-on-an-expanding-field", "http://www.art.cmu.edu/event/soccer-on-an-expanding-field/"]},
